API Packages
============

Defoe comes with a number of API packages included.

The one which has most recently been in active development and is therefore somewhat different, and more detailed, than the other APIs, is the :ref:`Find My Past (FMP) API <fmp-api>`.

.. note::

  Some of the API's listed below, if not all of them, are under active development.

# PSQL queries

General:

* [Normalize](./normalize.md) 

Key searches:
* [Count number of occurrences of keywords/keysentences (pages) and group by year](./keysearch_by_year.md)

**Note**: For running any of above queries, they need NLS pages to be stored previously in PSQL using [this query](../nls/write_pages_df_psql.md)


**Important:** We recommend to read also the documentation for [writing and reading data from/to PSQL](../nls_demo_examples/nls_demo_individual_queries.md#writing-and-reading-data-fromto-postgresql-database).
